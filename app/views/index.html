						    </tr>
						    <tr>
						      <td>Clearer relationship between numbers.</td>
						      <td>Users were often unclear about which numbers were part of which, for example how calls received related to transactions received by phone. A new page layout tries to clarify this.</td>

						    <tr>
						      <td>Data guidance in context.</td>
						      <td>As we're introducing new concepts and terms, we need to explain what they mean. Instead of having a separate 'guidance' section, we added information next to where the data is to save users clicking back and forth and reading long pages of text.</td>
						    </tr>
						    <tr>
						      <td>Used 'view all' as primary call to action, moved search to separate page.</td>
						      <td>Previous testing showed that users benefitted from seeing what data is available on the website, and are only likely to search in specific situations. We think that the need to search for something specific could be adequately met on a separate page.</td>
